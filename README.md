# NetsuiteEnvironmentViewer
Application to view and compare records and scripts between Netsuite environments

For application to be used, users will have to deploy the SuiteScript, suiteScripts/commonNetSuiteFunctions.js, into the desired Netsuite environments.

It should be deployed as a RESTlet, and the scriptId should be _customscript\_commonnetsuitefunctions_ and the deployId should be _customdeploy\_commonnetsuitefunctions_.

The application can also save settings to the user's local computer, if you choose.
