# NetsuiteEnvironmentViewer
Application to view and compare records and scripts between Netsuite environments

For application to be used, users will have to deploy the SuiteScript, suiteScripts/querySchema.js, into the desired Netsuite environments.
It should be deployed as a RESTlet, and the script id and deployment id should be *_queryschema*.

The application can also save settings to the user's local computer, if you choose.
